# Hooks & Session State Map

The Claude payload and installation details below were verified against Claude Code **2.1.238**. Recheck them for newer CLI versions. The cross-provider lifecycle contract lives in [session lifecycle](docs/session-lifecycle.md). The per-event payload schemas below come
from the [hooks reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks); every field name
Vibeyard reads is in that reference. An invented field name costs nothing at write
time and renders a blank timeline row forever, so treat this file as the contract
and re-check it against the docs whenever a hook changes.

## Scope

This document covers the **Claude Code** hook integration, which is the only
provider with a push-based hook system. The other backends reach the same session
state by different means:

| Provider | Status source |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | Hooks + statusLine (this document) |
| Codex CLI, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI | Hooks (subset of the events above) |
| Pi, Oh my Pi | Polled transcript sync — `src/main/session-transcript-sync.ts` |

The polled path deliberately mirrors the status convention described here, so a
finished turn looks the same in the UI regardless of which mechanism produced it.

## 25 Hook Events (7 core + 18 inspector-only)

Installation is **version-gated**: `claude-hook-versions.ts` maps each event to the
CLI version that introduced it, and `getSupportedHookEvents()` drops anything the
installed binary is too old for. An undetectable version installs nothing, so an
unrecognized key can never land in a user's `settings.json`.

### Core Hook Events → Session Status

| Hook Event | Session Status | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `SessionStart` | `waiting` | CLI session initialized, waiting for user input |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `working` | User submitted a prompt, CLI is processing |
| `PostToolUse` | `working` | Tool finished **successfully**, CLI still processing |
| `PostToolUseFailure` | `working` | Tool failed, CLI still processing (also captures failure details) |
| `Stop` | `completed` *or* `working` | See [Stop resolution](#stop-resolution) — a Stop is not always a completion |
| `StopFailure` | `waiting` | Response stopped with an API error, back to waiting |
| `PermissionRequest` | `input` | CLI is waiting for user input (permission, plan acceptance, etc.) |

`PostToolUse` fires **only on success**; a tool that ran and failed fires
`PostToolUseFailure` instead. Tool calls rejected before execution — unknown tool,
schema/tool-specific validation failure, permission denial — fire neither.

`PostToolUseFailure`'s status writer is `statusCmd`, a plain `sh -c echo` that
cannot read stdin, so it writes `working` even for an `is_interrupt` (user-abort)
failure. The renderer's `interrupted` latch (`session-activity.ts`) swallows that.

## Session State Machine

```
idle (default/no activity)
  │
  ▼  SessionStart
waiting ◄──── StopFailure
  │
  ▼  UserPromptSubmit
working ◄──── PostToolUse / PostToolUseFailure
  │
  ▼  Stop (with nothing in flight)
completed
  │
  ▼  new prompt
waiting
```

PTY exit removes the non-shell live session; it does not transition it back to `waiting`.

## Stop resolution

The main agent fires a top-level `Stop` **every time it pauses to wait on parallel
subagents**, so a naive `Stop → completed` produces false completion notifications
mid-orchestration. `stop_status_writer.py` decides which kind of Stop this is.

**Primary signal — `background_tasks` on the Stop payload.** Each entry is
`{id, type, status, description, ...}` with `type` one of `shell`, `subagent`,
`monitor`, `workflow`, `teammate`, `cloud session`, `MCP task`. The session is held
in `working` only for the types that mean *the model itself will produce more
output in this turn*:

| `type` | Holds `working`? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `subagent`, `teammate`, `workflow` | yes | The turn is blocked on it |
| `shell`, `monitor`, `MCP task`, `cloud session` | no | May wake a *future* turn; the user is free to type now |
| unknown | no | Fail toward `completed` — a missed notification beats a stuck session |

An entry in a terminal `status` (`completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`, …) is not in
flight. `session_crons` is deliberately **never** consulted: a `/loop` session
always has a pending cron and would otherwise never report completed.

**Only a non-empty array is authoritative.** An empty `background_tasks` is *not*
proof of an idle session: the CLI filters the list on an `isBackgrounded` flag
that Task-spawned subagents acquire only after an optional auto-background timer,
so a spurious Stop fired the instant the main agent pauses on freshly-dispatched
foreground subagents can report `[]` with several still running — the exact false
completion this writer exists to prevent. So an empty (or absent) array falls
through to the counter below, and the two signals are OR'd. Erring this way costs
at most a late notification, bounded by the renderer backstop; erring the other
way fires a completion mid-orchestration.

**Fallback — `<sid>.subagents`.** When `background_tasks` is empty or absent, the
writer falls back to a per-session counter that `captureEventCmd` maintains: `SubagentStart` increments,
`SubagentStop` decrements, `PostToolUse` with an `agent_id` refreshes its
timestamp, `SessionStart` resets it unless `source == "compact"`. The
read-modify-write is unlocked and can race, which is why it is a fallback and why
`STOP_STALE_MS` (10 min) ages it out.

`force_working` keys on **`agent_id` only**, never `agent_type`: `agent_type` is
also set on the *main thread* of a session started with `--agent` (reachable
through a session's extra args), so keying on it would wedge such a session in
`working` until the backstop fired.

**Backstop — `STOP_FALLBACK_MS`** (`session-activity.ts`, 10 min). Whenever a Stop
resolves to `working`, the renderer arms a timer that forces `completed` if the
session then goes silent. Both hook branches can be wrong — a hung `subagent` entry
that never leaves the registry has no timestamp to age it out — so this is the only
guarantee of eventual completion. Any later hook event cancels it.

## Smart Transition Rules (`session-activity.ts`)

1. **Completed is sticky** — `waiting` from Stop/StopFailure won't overwrite `completed`
2. **Interrupt guard** — stale `working` hooks (PostToolUse after Escape) are ignored when the `interrupted` flag is set
3. **Interrupt clear** — any non-`working` hook clears the `interrupted` flag

## How It Works End-to-End

1. **Hook installation** (`claude-cli.ts`) — each event gets a status writer, and
   `SessionStart`/`UserPromptSubmit` also get a session-id capture,
   `PostToolUseFailure` a failure capture, and every event an inspector event
   capture. Commands carry the `# vibeyard-hook` marker so reinstallation is
   idempotent and never touches a user's own hooks.
2. **File watching** (`hook-status.ts`) — the main process watches `STATUS_DIR`
   (`<tmpdir>/vibeyard`) via `fs.watch()` plus a 2s polling fallback.
3. **IPC broadcast** — main sends `session:hookStatus`, `session:costData`,
   `session:sessionName`, `session:toolFailure`, `session:inspectorEvents`, …
4. **State update** (`session-activity.ts`) — the renderer applies the rules above.

## Files Written into STATUS_DIR

| File Extension | Source | Data |
|---|---|---|
| `.status` | Status-writer hooks | `"<HookEvent>:<status>"` |
| `.sessionid` | `SessionStart` + `UserPromptSubmit` hooks, and the statusLine | CLI session ID, for resume |
| `.cost` | `statusline.py` (via the `statusLine` setting) | Cost, tokens, context window, model |
| `.name` | `statusline.py` | `session_name` for tab auto-titling |
| `.toolfailure` | `PostToolUseFailure`, plus a token-capped `Read` (see below) | `tool_name`, `tool_input`, `error` |
| `.events` | Every event's capture script | Bounded recent JSONL inspector timeline; see [event retention](docs/performance.md#inspector-event-retention) |
| `.subagents` | `SubagentStart`/`SubagentStop`/`PostToolUse`/`SessionStart` | `{n, t}` in-flight counter (Stop fallback only; never forwarded to the renderer) |

### The token-capped `Read` case

An oversized `Read` is no longer an error. Claude Code truncates it and returns a
**successful** `PostToolUse` whose `tool_response.file.truncatedByTokenCap` is
`true`, so the old `file content (N tokens) exceeds maximum allowed tokens` text no
longer exists. The `PostToolUse` script detects that one structured flag — scoped
to `tool_name == "Read"`, so it does no IO for any other tool — and writes a small
synthetic `.toolfailure` tagged with `TOKEN_TRUNCATION_SENTINEL`
(`shared/constants.ts`), which `large-file-detector.ts` keys on — shared by the
Python emitter and the TS detector so the two cannot drift.

`TOKEN_TRUNCATION_KEY` (the payload key, owned by Claude Code) is a *separate*
constant from `TOKEN_TRUNCATION_SENTINEL` (our message prefix, owned by us). One
constant doing both jobs meant rewording the message silently broke the payload
lookup, with every test still green because both sides moved together.

## Inspector-Only Hook Events (18 additional)

These write only to the `.events` log — they do NOT change session status.

| Hook Event | Inspector Event Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PreToolUse` | `pre_tool_use` | Before a tool executes |
| `PermissionDenied` | `permission_denied` | Tool call denied by Claude auto permissions |
| `SubagentStart` | `subagent_start` | Subagent spawned |
| `SubagentStop` | `subagent_stop` | Subagent finished |
| `Notification` | `notification` | Claude sent a notification |
| `PreCompact` | `pre_compact` | Context compaction starting |
| `PostCompact` | `post_compact` | Context compaction finished |
| `SessionEnd` | `session_end` | Session terminated |
| `TaskCreated` | `task_created` | Background task created |
| `TaskCompleted` | `task_completed` | Background task finished |
| `WorktreeRemove` | `worktree_remove` | Git worktree removed |
| `CwdChanged` | `cwd_changed` | Working directory changed |
| `FileChanged` | `file_changed` | Watched file modified on disk |
| `ConfigChange` | `config_change` | Configuration changed |
| `Elicitation` | `elicitation` | MCP server requests user input |
| `ElicitationResult` | `elicitation_result` | User answered elicitation |
| `InstructionsLoaded` | `instructions_loaded` | CLAUDE.md / rules loaded |
| `TeammateIdle` | `teammate_idle` | Teammate agent became idle |

`SessionEnd` carries an explicit `timeout: 5`. SessionEnd hooks share a 1.5s budget
by default — tight enough for a cold Python start to miss — and Claude Code raises
the budget to the highest configured per-hook timeout. It is a ceiling, not a wait.

### Events deliberately NOT installed

| Event | Why not |
|---|---|
| `WorktreeCreate` | A *path-replacement* hook: configuring it replaces Claude Code's own `git worktree` behavior, and the hook must create the worktree and print its path. An observer hook breaks worktree creation (#110). |
| `UserPromptExpansion` | Same class — its stdout can rewrite the user's prompt. |
| `MessageDisplay` | Fires once per assistant message with a 10s timeout. Each hook spawns a Python interpreter, so this roughly doubles hook overhead for data already on `Stop`'s `last_assistant_message`. |
| `Setup` | Runs at CLI setup, outside a session, so `CLAUDE_IDE_SESSION_ID` is unset and every script exits immediately. |
| `PostToolBatch` | Duplicates the per-tool events and would double-count in `getToolStats`. |
| `DirectoryAdded` | Cheap but near-zero value today; revisit if `/add-dir` becomes user-visible. |

## Inspector Payload Fields

`INSPECTOR_FIELDS` in `claude-cli.ts` is the single list of hook-payload fields
copied into an inspector event. A one-line assertion
(`readonly (keyof InspectorEvent)[] = INSPECTOR_FIELDS`) makes a field that isn't
on `InspectorEvent` a **compile error**, so the two can't drift silently the way
`config_key`/`question`/`answer` did. Strings are truncated at 2000 chars so a
long `last_assistant_message` doesn't bloat `.events` on every Stop.

The list is deliberately limited to fields something actually **reads**. There is
no generic payload viewer, so an unread field is written to disk, parsed, sent
over IPC and typed for nothing.

`reason` is intentionally shared across events (SessionEnd and PermissionDenied),
which is safe because the consuming timeline branch is selected by `ev.type`.

Deliberately not copied: `cwd` (a common field on every event, constant per
session — `CwdChanged` uses `new_cwd`/`old_cwd` instead), `requested_schema` /
`properties`, `compact_summary` / `custom_instructions`, and `background_tasks` /
`session_crons` (consumed by `stop_status_writer.py`).

**Watch for nested keys when reading the docs.** The Elicitation example contains
`requested_schema.properties.username.type`, which scans like top-level `type` and
`username` fields. Neither exists — an earlier pass added both and they were dead
on arrival. Elicitation's real discriminator is `mode` (`'form' | 'url'`).

## Validation (`settings-guard.ts`)

On each PTY creation the app validates that the core hooks are installed and the
statusLine is configured, returning `'missing'`, `'partial'`, or `'complete'` and
showing a warning banner if incomplete. Inspector-only hooks are not validated.
